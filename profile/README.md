## What is Forensic Toolkit Imager?

**Forensic Toolkit Imager (FTK Imager)** is a premier, industry-standard digital forensics software application designed for creating forensic images of computer storage devices. Unlike standard copying methods, which can alter file metadata and access times, FTK Imager creates a bit-for-bit, exact replica (an "image") of the original source, ensuring the integrity and admissibility of digital evidence in investigations. This process is crucial for preserving the original state of data without modification.

With Forensic Toolkit Imager, digital forensics experts, law enforcement personnel, and cybersecurity professionals can securely: Acquire evidence from hard disk drives (HDDs), solid-state drives (SSDs), USB flash drives, memory cards, and other storage media. Perform previews of the contents of a device without risking accidental writes to the original evidence. Create hashes (MD5, SHA-1) to verify the integrity of the acquired image, proving that the evidence has not been tampered with since its collection. Export files and folders from within an image for analysis. Mount forensic images as read-only virtual drives to examine their contents with other tools.

Its reliability, robust feature set, and free availability make FTK Imager an indispensable and trusted tool for digital forensics workflows worldwide. It is a foundational tool for anyone involved in incident response, cybercrime investigation, or data recovery.
